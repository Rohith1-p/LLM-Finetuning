# LLM-Finetuning
Finetune a Opensource LLM and optimizing the training 

The Google Colab files in this repository contain various open-source LLMs, fine-tuned using datasets from Hugging Face. Most models are under 7 billion parameters, as larger models require substantial GPU power, which can be costly. Since free GPU access is available on Google Colab and Kaggle Notebooks, I used Google Colab for training models under the 7 billion parameter limit.

These are some of the Opensource LLMs used in this respository. 
1. Llama
2. PHi-3
3. Mistral
4. There are other LLMs as well in my drive. I will add them when i get some free time.
